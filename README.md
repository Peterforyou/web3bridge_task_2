## Overview
This is a task from Frontend Mentor to build a Social proof section to aid my proficiency in learning Css flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to make my boxes higher than each other boxes in a given container by using the align self attribute in aligning the divs in a container.

```html
  <div class="testimony">
```
```css
 .testimony:first-child {
    align-self: flex-start;
  }
  .testimony:last-child {
    align-self: flex-end;
  }
```

### Continued development    

I would love focusing more on Css Flexbox especially when it comes to aligning self attribute and how it works in making my work look superb.
